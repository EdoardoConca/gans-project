# Generating Images with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
This project was developed as part of a deep learning examination. It focuses on testing the performance of two different generative adversarial network architectures, namely a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) and a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGANGP), for the purpose of image generation. The models were trained using the fashionmnist dataset, a variant of the MNIST dataset containing grayscale images of fashion items. The goal of the project was to assess the ability of these GAN architectures to generate realistic images resembling various fashion items such as clothing and accessories. Through experimentation and evaluation, insights were gained into the effectiveness and limitations of each architecture in generating high-quality images from a given dataset.
